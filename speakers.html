        <p>
            <strong>Dr. Bryan Perozzi</strong> is a Research Scientist at Google, working at the intersection of data mining, machine learning, and language models. He received the  2024 KDD Test of Time Award and the 2017 SIGKDD Dissertation Award for his pioneering work in network representation learning, particularly in the development of DeepWalk, one of the foundational algorithms for learning embeddings from graphs. His research has been widely influential, with numerous papers published in top-tier venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, KDD, and WWW, accumulating over 19,800 citations.
            His recent research focuses on advancing graph reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs).
